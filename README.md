# Disaster-Management
Project Main Objective is to gain Hands-on experience to process data, to extract information, and discover patterns or
knowledge using data mining method.
Project contains 5 milestones- Data Acquistion- data is collected from the given link provided and will check for the null values.
Data Preprocessing- In this step Null values are checked and replaced using mean imputation method and Message column from the dataset has been cleaned by defining function in the python.
Mining Tool Preparation- After cleaning the data converted CSV to ARFF and applied nominal to string vector filter in Weka and processed it.
Clustering Analysis - After applying the filter, clustering techniques are used and the data is divided into 3 clusters and instances are given.
Visualization- From the clustered output data is collected and those data is visualized and will find out top-100 words and DIKW will be defined here from the word cloud.
Project is implemented using Python, R and Weka.
